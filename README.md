## 🤖 Google Technologies Used

This project is designed to integrate with the following Google technologies:

- **Google Gemini API** – For understanding civic issues described in natural language and future image-based issue detection.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** – For scalable backend services and deployment.
- **Firebase** – For storing user reports and managing real-time complaint data.
- **Google Maps API** – For capturing and visualizing the location of reported civic issues.

Currently, the prototype demonstrates the user interface and complaint generation workflow, and is built to be extended with these Google AI and Cloud services.
